                <div class="des">
                    <p>Coffee is a plant (Coffea) and the name of the drink that is made from this plant. The coffee
                        plant is a bush or tree that can grow up to ten meters (about 32 feet) high, but is usually cut
                        shorter. Coffee plants originally grew in Africa, and now also grow in South America, Central
                        America and Southeast Asia. They are an important crop for the economies of many countries.
                        The first branded coffee to be sold commercially to the public was Nescafé in 1879. The drink is
                        made from the seeds of the coffee plant, called coffee beans. Coffee is usually served hot, and
                        is a popular drink in many countries. Coffee contains a chemical called caffeine, a mild drug
                        that keeps people awake.
                        To make a drink from coffee beans, the beans must first be specially prepared by drying the
                        beans and then roasting. The beans are dried a short time after they are picked. This preserves
                        them and makes them ready to be packed or roasted. Before the beans are made into a drink, they
                        must be roasted or ground (crushed into tiny pieces in a coffee mill). When the ground coffee is
                        placed into boiling water, the flavour and dark brown colour of the beans goes into the water.
                        Making coffee is called brewing coffee. There are several different ways that coffee can be
                        brewed.
                        Coffee contains a number of useful nutrients, including riboflavin, niacin, magnesium,
                        potassium, and various phenolic compounds, or antioxidants.

                    <h3 id="varhead">Varieties Of Coffees</h3><br>
                    <p id="types">Coffee is a brewed drink made from coffee beans, which are actually the roasted seeds
                        of the coffee plant. The species of bean used, where it was sourced from, and how it was roasted
                        will all affect the taste and aroma of the final cup you'll sip. The two main categories of
                        coffee beans you'll come across are Arabica and Robusta. So what's the difference?</p><br>

                    <div class="colortext">
                        <p id="all">
                        <h3> Arabica </h3>
                        You may have seen bags of coffee labeled "100 percent Arabica." Arabica is the most popular type
                        of bean used for coffee. <br> Arabica beans are considered higher quality than Robusta, and
                        they're
                        also more expensive. <br> They result in coffee with a sweeter, less harsh taste. <br>


                        <h3> Robusta</h3>
                        Robusta beans are typically cheaper to produce because the Robusta plant is easier to grow. <br>
                        They
                        have a higher caffeine content and taste more bitter than Arabica beans. <br> These beans are
                        often
                        used to make instant coffee and espresso blends. <br>

                        <h3>Black Coffee</h3>
                        No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. <br>
                        It's
                        served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings. <br>
                        <h3>Decaf</h3>
                        Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use several different processes to
                        remove almost all of it. <br> Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans. <br>
                        <h3>Espresso</h3>
                        Most people know that a shot of espresso is stronger than the same amount of coffee, but what's
                        the difference, exactly? <br> There isn't anything inherently different about the beans
                        themselves,
                        but when beans are used to make espresso they're more finely ground, <br> and they're brewed
                        with a
                        higher grounds-to-water ratio than what's used for coffee. The result is a thicker, more
                        concentrated <br> liquid with a bolder flavor. A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also
                        the
                        base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. <br>

                        ￼
                        <h3>Buff Strickland</h3>
                        This classic drink is typically 1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of
                        foam, <br> but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations. <br> You can
                        experiment
                        with flavored syrups like vanilla and pumpkin spice or create a nondairy version by using oat
                        milk. <br>



                        <h3>Cappuccino</h3>
                        This espresso-based drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker. <br> The
                        standard ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a <br>
                        6-ounce
                        cup (smaller than a latte cup) and can be topped with a sprinkling of <br> cinnamon. <br>
                        <h3>Macchiato</h3>
                        A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just a touch of steamed milk or foam. <br> In Italian,
                        macchiato means <br> "stained" or "spotted," so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been
                        stained <br> with milk. <br>
                        <h3>Americano</h3>
                        Order this drink and you'll get a shot of espresso diluted with hot water. <br>
                        <h3>Café au Lait</h3>
                        This fancy-sounding French drink is actually super simple: It's equal parts coffee <br> and
                        steamed
                        or scalded milk. <br>
                        <h3>Cortado</h3>
                        This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many <br>
                        Italian
                        coffee drinks, it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce <br> glass.
                        <br>
                        <h3>Flat White</h3>
                        Like the latte, this drink consists of espresso and steamed milk, but the ratio of espresso to
                        <br>
                        milk is higher. Baristas also fold the milk as it steams, which creates a more velvety texture.
                        <br>

            <h2>1 Starbucks:</h2>
            <p> Founded in 1971 at Seattle, Washington

                Everyone knows about Starbucks, thanks to their aggressive marketing and shrewd advertising
                techniques. But, does everyone like Starbucks coffee? The answer differs.

                The brand is not known for sourcing and roasting the best coffee beans. Most of their coffee beans
                are dark roasted, meaning, they taste bitter. And many consumers, who know their coffee, complain
                that Starbucks coffee has a distinct burnt taste.

                But that is okay with the company. The company knows what the average consumers like – caffeine.
                And, their coffees contain a high amount of caffeine. And, Starbucks keeps coming up with blended
                and modified versions of their coffee. Thanks to regular tasting panels, the company knows just how
                much tweaking it takes to target the average consumers.

                Plus, Starbucks gives you a lot of options to choose from. And according to its official sources, it
                does offer gourmet coffees, but that might not be the one you get from them daily.

                Besides, the company is trying to be more eco-friendly. They are introducing more plant-based meal
                options, shifting away from single-use cups, and trying to manage their wastage better and…let's
                hope that's the beginning of something extraordinary.

                <h2>2 Dunkin' Doughnuts</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1950 at Canton, Massachusetts

                    Dunkin' is not as big a brand as Starbucks but they are second in line in the number of stores. But
                    yes, the coffee Dunkin' offers is surely somewhat superior to Starbucks. For instance, Dunkin' does
                    not have the signature burnt taste in coffee as Starbucks does. The coffee is also cheaper.

                    The key difference between the two companies is that Dunkin' is more of a traditional eatery while
                    Starbucks is a premium coffee house with greater scope to customise and choose from an extensive
                    menu.

                    The cool thing about Dunkin', though, is that you get free doughnuts sometimes.</p><br><img

                <p>Founded in 1971 at London, United Kingdom

                    Costa coffee is one of the largest coffee chains in Britain. Having its presence in more than 31
                    countries worldwide, it has more than 3000 outlets serving coffee with around 18 thousand branches
                    in the whole world.

                    Costa coffees are medium roasted, which makes them smoother, sweeter, and nuttier.</p><br><img

                <p>Founded in 1993 at Melbourne, Australia

                    Owned by McDonald's, McCafe is one of the leading coffee chains in countries like Australia and New
                    Zealand. McCafé enjoys the benefit of having a vast presence (Because let's face it, McDonald's is
                    everywhere!) As McDonald's expands worldwide, there is a decent chance of McCafé doing the same.

                    The coffee here, however, is freshly brewed every 30 minutes, so it is never stale. And although it
                    is medium roasted, it has a bitter taste although has flavours options to add with the coffee.

                    You see, the lighter roasted coffee is, the more flavourful it tends to get. So, when having a
                    coffee at McCafé, prepare to get the nutty aftertaste.

                    Besides, the coffees are cheap.</p> <img src="./mcca.jpg" alt="" id="mcc">

                <p>Founded in 1966 at California, United States

                    Peet's coffee is said to be fairly stronger than the coffee Starbucks serves so it might not be for
                    everyone. Peet's has a long history of serving darker roasted Arabica coffee. The coffee supposedly
                    has a variety of flavours .

                    If you are someone who cannot stand the burnt taste in coffee, maybe you will like Peet's. Also, the
                    store layout is traditional and the brand maintains a good relationship with its supply chain (aka,

                    If there is another coffee everyone has heard of, it is Nescafe. It's present almost anywhere in the
                    globe. The instant coffee by Nescafe is unbeatable, not so much by taste as it is for availability.

                    As for the taste, it sure is not the best instant coffee. Plus, the immediate rejuvenating feeling
                    you get after a cup of Nescafe, tends to wear off within an hour or two.

                    One of the main reasons Nescafe is so popular is because of its host company Nestle. Nestle used its
                    deep pockets and smart marketing to get Nescafe everywhere around the world. Distribution support
